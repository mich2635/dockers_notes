DOCKERS
	Dockers is a build and deployment tool,the main idea is we can put together 
all the required dependencies installation commands together the  code so that it 
installs the dependencies first to run the application..we can automate this by putting 
inside a .yml file and specify the actions

CONTAINERS
	Containers follows the same concept of classes in java we can put many images 
inside it ,these containers can contact with other and also contact with external 
applications

IMAGES
	Images follows object concept of java we can add many imges inside the 
containers ,we can download  images from the Dockerhub.official images has official 
tags in the hub

TYPES OF DEFAULT NETWORK IN DOCKERS
	1)None network
	2)bridge network
	3)overlay network

BASIC COMMANDS
	docker ps  				-We can can get running containers using this commands
	docker images   			-See all the images
	docker run image_name			-run the images
	docker run -d image_name		-run the images in background
	docker run pd image_name:tag		-we can run the specific version of the image using the command
	docker run -d --name Image_name my_name	-We can give a name for the images
	docker pull image_name			-We can pull image from the  hub using this command
	docker start -d container_name		-starts the conatainer
	docker stop				-Stops the running container
	docker logs container_name		-see the logs of the particular container
